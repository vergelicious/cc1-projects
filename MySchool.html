Up the zigzag road, you will find your way
Leading to the gate of learning,
Give the place some thought, you can't go astray
There is where you'll hear them singing
*** Neath the tall and stalwart pine trees
Our Alma Mater proudly stands;
Over hill and over valleys with full command upon the strand
There is where my mind is nourished
With the wisdom that I need
There is where I reap some knowledge
My heart to strengthen my creed.
***
Hear the murmur of those pine trees
Feel the softness of mountain breeze
If you have some ambition
The right inspiration, you'll find in the Baguio Colleges
(Repeat ***)</center>

<pre style="text-align: justify"><center>

	Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary
education in the mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio
City after the Second World War.
	Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at
that time, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he
undauntedly pursued a noble mission by founding a college.
	It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic
event unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal
arts, with the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces
at the Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main
thoroughfare.
	1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation.
Since then, it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time.
	The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins
of the presidency up to the early part of 1994.
	Through the years, the University of the Cordilleras has grown bigger through the offering of additional
courses and increasing student enrollment. It continues to grow even better with time, as evidenced by
exemplary performance in various fields of discipline, with its graduates shining in national licensure
examinations, and its alumni doing well in private employment, in the practice of their trade and profession,
and in public service.
	Today, the University of the Cordilleras caters to more than 15,000 students coming from the Cordillera
Administrative Region (CAR), Regions I and II, as well as from neighboring provinces in Luzon. Course offerings
range from graduate studies, law, arts and sciences, nursing, engineering and architecture, commerce and secretarial,
teacher education, computer science, technical courses, elementary and high school.
	The University's College of Law is rated among the top law schools in the country, having graduated bar
topnotchers as of year 2007. The Colleges of Engineering, Criminology, Information and Computer Science, and
Teacher Education have gained recognition as among the top colleges in the region and the country. The College
of Nursing, although newly-opened, has already shown an optimistic outlook with its exceptional performance in
its first ever nursing board examinations.
	The future looks bright for the University of the Cordilleras, and we're glad to be blessed to serve these
mountain highlands of the Philippines. Mabuhay!

College of Information Technology and Computer Science
</pre></center>
<pre style="text-align: justify"><center>
	In 1986, the University of the Cordilleras, then known as the Baguio Colleges Foundation, became the first institution in
Baguio City to offer a four-year course in Computer Science. Under the umbrella of the Arts and Sciences, this new division
started with barely 100 students, 4 faculty members, and one course offering: Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science.
With its transition from a division to a separate college in June 1995, the College grew to more than 1,200 students and 34 faculty members.
	In keeping with the philosophy of the University of the Cordilleras, the College of Information Technology and Computer Science has
recognized its responsibility to respond to the changing needs of society, particularly in the field of Information Technology.
	The College is aware that today's technology revolves around the indispensability of the computer in the fields of computations,
database systems, web & graphics, networking & security, mobile technology and digital arts.
	The present courses offered by the College are geared towards bolstering computing competencies, a vital role it plays in the community.
	In 2007, CHED Conferred the highest academic status to the college as "Center of Excellence". UC holds the distinction of being among
the nation's top nine(9) in IT education.

	To fulfill these, the College shall strive to:
		Upgrade periodically the Institution's course offerings focusing on innovative tools, current trends, and industry requirements;
		Prepare the student to apply his/her acquired academic skills to his/her related profession with commitment and dedication;
		Excel in the use of Information Technology (IT) facilities, their prototypes and development, including evaluations and tests; and
		Become the Institution's number one provider of Information Technology tools to promote people productivity at lower costs.
		
	Programs
		Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
		Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics
		Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
		Associate in Computer Technology
		
	Mission and Vision
		The CITCS mission is to provide competent instruction geared towards the development of responsible Information Technology (IT) professionals
	equipped with skills and strong moral values, thus, becoming the preferred source of services and manpower .

	The rice terraces, often called the eighth wonder of the world, is a symbol of the genius of our race.
	They show the industry, patience and skill of the early Filipinos in this part of the highlands where
	UC is situated. The leaves of the pine tree, an evergreen, denote youth and its fresh and courageous
	outlook. The torch, the classical symbol of learning, means that while UC is dedicated to the
	cultivation of a distinct Filipino culture, it has profited from the teachings of other cultures.
	The shield implies that education, the birthright of everyone, is a protection against the inadequacy,
	intolerance, and slavery of the mind.
